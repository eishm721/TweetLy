# FILENAME: similarity.py

# Probability algorithm implementation to find which user most closely
# matches a set of data based on "Bag of Words" probability model.

# Uses Bayesian model to create indicator for approximating P(writer|unknownTest)
# using P(unknownText|writer). Models probabilities with multinomial
# distribution. Logarithmic similarity index computed to prevent underflow.
